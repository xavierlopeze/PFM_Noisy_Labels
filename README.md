## Deep Learning with noisy labels
This repository is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the Master's Degree in Master's Degree in Fundamental Principles of Data Sciencee supervised by Petia Radeva, PhD and Javier Ródenas. 

In this thesis we explore techniques to make Deep Learning robust on noisy datasets. With noisy datasets we mean datasets that contain samples wrongly labeled. We will work on compution vision supervised classification problems of mutually exclusive classes (i.e. without overlap). 
We particulary focus on MLNT and VAEs.

Our results suggest that over datasets with noisy labels MLNT is able to consistently outperform a conventional cross-entropy learning approach.
